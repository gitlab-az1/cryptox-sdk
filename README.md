# CryptX SDK

## Overview of Modules

- **Hashing**: Provides hashing algorithms such as 'sha1', 'sha256', 'sha512', and 'md5', along with HMAC ('sha1', 'sha256', 'sha512') support.

- **Key Derivation**: Offers key derivation algorithms including 'pbkdf2' and 'argon2'.

- **OTP (One-Time Passwords)**: Supports generation of one-time passwords.

- **TOTP (Time-based One-Time Passwords)**: Provides functionality for generating time-based one-time passwords.

- **Embedding**: Enables transformation of databases like PostgreSQL and other supported ones into vectorial databases.

- **Binary Comparison**: Allows comparison of two `Uint8Array` instances and returns true if they are equal.

- **Deep Comparison**: Provides a mechanism for comparing two `Uint8Array` instances using HMAC and returns true if they are equal.

- **Random Byte Generation**: Generates random bytes.

- **Bit Rotation (rotl)**: Rotates bits to the left.

- **Random Value Generation**: Generates random values.

- **Integer to Byte Array Conversion**: Converts an integer to a byte array.
